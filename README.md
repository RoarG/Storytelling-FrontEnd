# VettuHva-FrontEnd

"Vettu Hva?" was developed in the spring of 2015. The idea for "Vettu Hva?" was proposed by SINTEF, and was further developed in cooperation with a group of students as part of a customer-driven project at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Students have implemented the application under the guidance of SINTEF.

Application is made in the context of EU / FP7 IST research TAG CLOUD. The aim of the project is to generate increased interest in cultural heritage through a personalized cultural experience.

##### To sign apk file: 
* Keytool (JDK)
* jarsigner (JDK)
* zipalign (JDK)

<i>(Not needed for browser testing)</i>

### iOS Specific (only possible on Mac OSX)
* Xcode (install from the App Store)
	Minimum required version is Xcode 4.5. More on this at [Cordova.apache.org](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.3.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide)


## Setup Guide

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/download/) 


2. Install Cordova and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) 

  	```npm install -g cordova ionic```
    
  
3. Install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)

  	```npm install -g gulp```
    
  
3. Restore State (Install dependencies)

  	```ionic state restore```
    

4. Setup the Backend
	
	[VettuHva_Backend](https://github.com/ewolden/vettu-hva) Backend repository
    

5. Configure the backend service (js/backendServices.js)


```javascript
  /**Handles communication with backend*/
stories.factory("Requests", function ($http) {
	var req = {
		method: 'POST',
		url: 'http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXXX/requests/controller.php',
		headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
	}
	
	var tok = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"; //Add the correct token here 
```


Change the URL to where the backend is located, and the token (tok) set in backend


  
## Testing 

Use these commands in the root folder of the project to run the application.

### Android

First run:

```ionic build android```

<b>Emulator</b> 

<i>(Note that the default Android emulator has many problems and is not recommended to use)</i>

```ionic emulate android```

<b>Device</b>

```ionic run android```

Read more about ionic testing here: [Ionic Framwork](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/testing.html)

### iOS

First run:

```ionic build ios```

<b>Emulator</b>

You need to run this to install the emulator: ```npm install -g ios-sim```

```ionic emulate ios```

<b>Device</b> <i> (requires Apple Developer account)</i>

```ionic run ios```

<b>Ionic View app</b>

You can install an app on iOS called Ionic view, and test "Vettu Hva?" through it. 
Requires an Ionic user. 

Run: 

```ionic upload```

You will then be asked to enter login information. 

Then it should be possible to download and run in Ionic View. If it for some reason should not appear, click on the eye icon at the top left and enter the ID from the command line. 

More information about Ionic View: [Ionic.io](http://blog.ionic.io/view-app-is-alive/)

### Browser 

The application requires internet access.
Testing this way is not recommended. The app uses cordova plugins, and these will not work in the browser. 

<b>Both platforms</b> (Android and iOS) in one view

 ```ionic serve --lab```
 
<b>Single view</b> which can be resized

 ```ionic serve```


## Building
  
### Android

1. Generate release build

  ```cordova build --release android ``` 

2. Generate key

  ```keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 ``` 
  
3. Signing the APK

  ```jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore HelloWorld-release-unsigned.apk alias_name ``` 
  
Where the AKP is located i.e. StoryTelling-Frontend\platforms\android\ant-build

3. Optimize the APK

  ```zipalign -v 4 HelloWorld-release-unsigned.apk HelloWorld.apk```  

<i>(These steps are necessary to update the application after you published it the first time) </i>

PS. Save the keystore file generated in step 2 for further patching.

### iOS
Apple Developer account required. You can open the .xcodeproj project from the platforms/ios folder. 

You need to set up Xcode with your certificates:
